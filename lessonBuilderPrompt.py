### INSTRUCTIONS:
Your task is to **generate the content for the given component** based on the **prompt** passed to you. 

- Read the provided **prompt** and generate the content according to the appropriate component's fields.
- Make sure to include **all required fields** for that component.
- The content should be well-structured and follow the specifications.
- **Return the content as a stringified JSON** (i.e., as a plain string containing JSON format).

### OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return the output in stringified json only, nothing wrapped before or after it.
The stringified json should use all the fields for the component that you are building, 
from the components defined in the components section.

### Example for LessonHeader:
For the LessonHeader component, the prompt could be:
"Create a LessonHeader for a lesson on Newton's 3rd law for high school students."
Please follow this rule for all components.

=== STRICT RULES ===
-The output should only contain the Stringified JSON. The Stringified JSON should not be wrapped with anything
-The output should be lengthy and verbose, and must sound natural, like a tutor.

=== GENERATE THE CARD BASED ON THE PROVIDED PROMPT ===
Prompt: {question}

=== CONTEXT FOR CONTENT GENERATION ===
Context: {context}
